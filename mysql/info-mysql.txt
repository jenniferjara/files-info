When do we use backticks and quotes in SQL?

- Backticks (`) are used to indicate database, table, and column names. Unless you're using reserved or conflicting words for table and database names, you'll not need to use them.

- Quotes (' or ") are used to delimit strings, and differentiate them from column names.

For example 

SELECT * FROM `database`.`table` WHERE `column` = "value";

But, backticks aren't needed, if you use reasonable table and column names:

SELECT * FROM mydb.users WHERE username = "jim";

But strings will always need quotes. 
This query is comparing the value in the column username against a value in the column bob:

SELECT * FROM mydb.users WHERE username = bob;
